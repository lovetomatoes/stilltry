Dear Editorial team,
Thank you for sending us the proof.
We have read the Q1, Q2 and fully respect the rules of the journal.
===
Q2:
We would prefer that the tile is adjusted in one line.
If the current tile is too long to be matched after the editorial process,
we agree that the title will be shortened as
"Evolution of High-redshift Quasar Hosts and Promotion of Massive Black Hole Formation".
or split into 2 lines as "Evolution of High-redshift Quasar Hosts // and Promotion of Massive Black Hole Seed Formation".
===
Q3:
The Chinese characters of the authors are Wenxiu Li (李 文秀), with a blank space
after the first character, and (邱 宇) is associated with the third author (Yu Qiu).
In addition, we would like the 1st/2nd authors (Wenxiu Li and Kohei Inayoshi) to
be the corresponding authors, i.e., double corresponding authors.
This has been approved by the Editor during the review process.
The email address of the 2nd author (Kohei Inayoshi) is
inayoshi@pku.edu.cn.
===
Q4:
The ORCID iDs are correct, but the "ORCID iDs" in page 18 are not correct.
They should be:
Wenxiu Li (李 文秀) https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1044-4081
Kohei Inayoshi https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9840-4959
Yu Qiu (邱 宇) https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6164-8463
